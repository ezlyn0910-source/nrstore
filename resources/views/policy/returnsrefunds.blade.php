<h3>Non-Returnable Items</h3>
<p>
Certain items may not be eligible for return due to hygiene reasons, clearance sales, digital products, or customized orders unless required by law.
</p>

<h3>Refund Process</h3>

Approved refunds will be processed using the original payment method. Refund timelines may vary depending on payment providers and financial institutions.
</p>

<h3>Exchanges</h3>
